# Abstract DAO 

Since I needed to write way to many similar DAO classes I tried an approach to make an abstract DAO class which would generate some basic functionality, simply by extending the from the Abstract-DAO. Since we have now Spring Data this is now somewhat superfluous.

As disclaimer, this was not my idea. I found it on some blog post a long time ago and forgot where.
